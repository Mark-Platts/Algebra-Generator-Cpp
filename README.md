# Algebra-Generator-Cpp
A simple console app for practicing algebra. Written in C++.

The instructions are all given by the program. Questions can be generated for five different levels of complexity. Once a question is generated, the answer can be attempted or instead the user may choose to see a step by step solution to the equation.

I wrote this program in order to practice the fundamentals of C++. The program needed a little of everything and put me in a good place to further explore what C++ has to offer.

There are a few known issues. But these are to do with the design rather than my code. 1) Occasionally, a nonsense equation is given when the generating function uses x = 0 as its answer. 2) Sometimes on the higher levels, very large numbers appear in the question. This doesn't break anything, but is annoying for anyone who is solving the questions. Both of these will require a total rethink of the equation generating function, which I plan to do when I can.
